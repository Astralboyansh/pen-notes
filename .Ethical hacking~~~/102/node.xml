    <rich_text> is One of the most popular identity management service(ims)

i.e. it allows sys admins to control various parts of the systems stored as objects (like entries in a phonebook)

this include users, groups, network resources, authentications etc.

these allow sysadmins to set policys properties and rules for these “objects” centrally

any machine on the server will be connected to the central server and hence accepts all connections and updates all policys remotely.

authentication over active directory happens over kerberos tickets.
