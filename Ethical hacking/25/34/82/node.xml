    <rich_text>NetBIOS is an old (1980s) session layer service that offers an API for communication between applications on a LAN, that predates TCP/IP. It’s not a protocol itself, but an API that leverages other communications protocol (ex: NBT leverages tcp, NBF: IEEE 802.2 LLC, NBX: NetWare's IPX/SPX)

In modern networks, NetBIOS runs over TCP/IP, termed NBT⁴ (or NetBT) and hence allows netbios services over tcp

NetBIOS is used as a fallback for name resolution only when mDNS (firstly), and then LLMNR (secondly) queries fail.

NetBIOS effectively offers backwards compatibility for network devices that predate compatibility with DNS

Netbios services:

138- Netbios-dgm: sending and receiving of connectionless, non-sequenced datagrams between hosts (allows to discover smb hosts in the network)
